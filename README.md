- Display of 20 points on each hand (s).
- Retrieval of the coordinates of the 20 points per hand (s) in lists.
- Display of the type of hand (Right or Left).
- Recovery of the type of hand.
- Display of a "box" around each hand (s).
- Retrieval of the coordinates of this "box".
- Recovery of the center of this "box".

## _Detection of a body:_
- Tracking a body.
- Display of 32 points on the body.
- Retrieve the 32 points in a list.
- Display of a "box" around the body.
- Retrieval of the coordinates of the "box".
- Recovery of the center of this "box".

## _Detection of one or more faces:_
- Detection of one or more faces.
- Display of a square around the face (s) and the detection score.

## _Mesh on or more faces:_
- Detection of one or more faces then application of a mesh of 468 points.
- Display of the mesh and contours of the face.
